How will Order ↔ Inventory talk?

Two options:

1️⃣ REST (synchronous) ❌
Tight coupling
Hard to scale
Bad for payments

2️⃣ EVENTS + SAGA ✅ (WE CHOOSE THIS)
Loose coupling
Failure handling
Industry standard

👉 We’ll use Saga – Choreography pattern.

If inventory fails:

What Happens WITHOUT @Transactional

Let’s walk through your exact code without @Transactional.

Scenario: Two users order the same product at the same time
Initial state:

Product P1 → availableQuantity = 5

🧪 Thread 1 (Order A)
inventory = findById(P1)  // gets 5

🧪 Thread 2 (Order B)
inventory = findById(P1)  // also gets 5


❌ Both see the same stock

Thread 1 continues
inventory.setAvailableQuantity(3);
repository.save(inventory);

Thread 2 continues
inventory.setAvailableQuantity(3);
repository.save(inventory);

💥 RESULT (DATA CORRUPTION)

You sold 4 items, but DB says:

availableQuantity = 3


❌ Overselling
❌ Financial loss
❌ Broken inventory

THIS is why inventory systems fail in production.



🚨 Another Critical Case: Exception After Update

Without @Transactional:

inventory.setAvailableQuantity(2);
repository.save(inventory);

// boom 💥
throw new RuntimeException("Kafka failed");

Result:
❌ Stock reduced
❌ Order not completed
❌ No rollback

Now inventory is wrong forever.

✅ What @Transactional Fixes

With @Transactional:

Case 1: Concurrent requests
DB applies row-level locking
Second transaction waits
Correct stock deduction

Case 2: Exception occurs
Entire transaction rolls back
Inventory remains unchanged

🧠 Very Important Detail (Advanced)

@Transactional works at DB level, not JVM level.

Uses ACID properties

Managed by Spring + Hibernate

Commits only at method end

⚠️ Subtle but CRITICAL Rule

@Transactional works ONLY when:

Method is public

Called from another Spring bean

❌ This will NOT work:

this.reserveStock();

“Without @Transactional, inventory updates are not atomic, leading to race conditions, overselling, and inconsistent state.
@Transactional ensures isolation and rollback, which is critical in payment and inventory systems.”


# Spring boot 4+ is not working with H2

Why Optimistic Locking (Quick Reminder)
No DB row lock
High throughput
Detects conflicts instead of blocking
Perfect when collisions are rare (e-commerce)

Hibernate adds version to WHERE clause during update
If version changed → update fails
Prevents lost updates

UPDATE inventory
SET available_quantity = ?, version = version + 1
WHERE product_id = ? AND version = ?

If another transaction updated it first:
rows affected = 0
Hibernate throws OptimisticLockException

We used optimistic locking with a version column to prevent lost updates during concurrent inventory reservations,
validated using multithreaded integration tests

Optimistic locking works only across transactions.
Annotating the test with @Transactional caused all threads to share one transaction, so locking didn’t trigger.

Why we are not using synchronized
“synchronized provides thread safety only within a JVM. synchronized fails in horizontal scaling.
In a horizontally scaled system with multiple instances, each JVM has its own lock, so it cannot prevent concurrent updates to shared resources like a database.”

1️⃣ What should happen when optimistic locking fails?

There are only 3 correct strategies:
✅ Option A — Retry (most common)
Try again because the conflict was temporary.

✅ Option B — Fail fast
Tell the caller: “Stock changed, try again.”

✅ Option C — Compensate
Used in distributed workflows (Saga).

For inventory → retry is usually correct.

Why retry works here

Concurrency conflicts are rare and short-lived.

Timeline:

T1 updates inventory
T2 fails due to version mismatch
T2 retries → reads fresh state → succeeds or fails cleanly
